            <p>
                At JANOLI International Journals, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of publication
                ethics. Our mission is to promote transparency, originality, and ethical practices in all aspects of
                academic publishing. We strive to foster an environment where authors, reviewers, and editors embrace
                their respective responsibilities and adhere to ethical guidelines throughout the publication journey.
                By fostering a culture of responsible publishing, we aim to safeguard intellectual property rights,
                avoid breaches of academic integrity, and uphold the reputation of researchers and institutions
                worldwide.
                In collaboration with reputable organizations such as COPE, WAME, CONSORT, ICMJE, and Elsevier PERK, we
                have curated the following publication ethics guidelines to serve as a roadmap for authors and
                contributors. <br>
                All submissions must align with our ethics guidelines:

                <li>
                    <strong>Multiple Submissions and Copyright Infringement</strong><br>
                    Once a paper is submitted to JANOLI International Journals for consideration, the author(s) are not
                    allowed to submit it to any other journals until a decision is made. Republishing similar scientific
                    material, whether text, figures, or tables, is not only unethical but may also infringe on
                    copyrights. If the paper is accepted for publication by JANOLI International Journals, the author(s)
                    must sign a copyright transfer agreement confirming the originality of the submitted research.
                    Therefore, authors should submit their work in its original, unpublished form.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Ethical Integrity and Plagiarism</strong><br>
                    Authors submitting papers to JANOLI International Journals must address major ethical concerns,
                    including plagiarism, fraudulent and duplicate publication, copyright violations, authorship, and
                    conflicts of interest. Authors must ensure that their work is original, does not violate
                    intellectual property rights, and does not plagiarize other published works.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Author's Responsibilities</strong><br>
                    Authors should acknowledge that they are solely responsible for the information contained in their
                    submitted or published manuscripts. Submission of the same paper to multiple journals simultaneously
                    is unacceptable. Authors must not submit work that has been previously published, wholly or
                    partially, without proper citation. Any information received privately must be appropriately cited
                    with the agreement of the third party involved.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Ethical Approval and Conflict of Interest Disclosure</strong><br>
                    Authors must provide evidence of anonymization and informed consent from clients or patients, if
                    applicable. Formal and documented ethical approval from an authorized research ethics committee must
                    also be made accessible. Authors are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest,
                    whether professional or financial, related to their article.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Authorship Criteria</strong><br>
                    Authorship should be determined based on significant contributions to the conception, design, data
                    collection, analysis, interpretation, and critical revision of the work. Authors must approve the
                    final version for publication and take responsibility for the integrity of the entire work.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Procedure for Evaluation</strong><br>
                    All submitted papers undergo a technical review to ensure they meet fundamental standards. The
                    editorial office conducts a plagiarism check using appropriate software. Improperly prepared or
                    unauthorized submissions may be rejected without peer review. The review process is double-blind,
                    with the names of reviewers and authors kept confidential. At least two reviewers provide feedback
                    before the Editor-in-Chief makes a final decision.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Archiving and Ownership</strong><br>
                    JANOLI International Journals ensure archiving of journal content to preserve access in the event of
                    discontinuation. The Shanti Educational Research Foundation in India owns the journal.
                </li>
            </ol>
